# Daily Planner

## Description
- I created this program using JavaScript and third-party APIs such as jQuery and DayJS to help me better understand third-party APIs.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The webpage will display the current date and time below the header, and the time blocks will change color according to the hour: <span style="color:red">Red</span> for present, <span style="color: green">green</span> for future, and <span style="color: gray">gray</span> for past. To add an event to a time block, simply type some text into the block, then click the save button. This will save the event even after the page is refreshed.
